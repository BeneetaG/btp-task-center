# Working with Filter Tabs

*Filter Tabs* organize your tasks in prefiltered semantic groups for better efficiency.

The *Filter Tabs* display tasks from different providers based on semantic categories, configured by your administrator. That way, you don't have to apply filters to see only your tasks from a given category; for example, your purchase-related tasks originating from different systems in your company. In addition, the *Filter Tabs* display the number of tasks from the semantic categories in your inbox.

Your administrator enables the *Filter Tabs* in the SAP Task Center Web app. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

The *Filter Tabs* configured by your administrator are displayed in alphabetical order. The default tab *All* is always in first position and shows all your tasks as they are fetched from the SAP Task Center task cache. The *Others* tab is always in the last position.

Each semantic group is displayed with a different icon and name in *Filter Tabs*. These icons and names are displayed based on the configuration done by your administrator. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

> ### Note:  
> Except for the *Others* tab, the names of the *Filter Tabs* are not translatable. For more information, see [Configure Filter Tabs in the SAP Task Center Web App](../40-administration/configure-filter-tabs-in-the-sap-task-center-web-app-53157da.md).

You can sort, filter, group, and search in *Filter Tabs*.

> ### Note:  
> The applied sorting, filtering, or search criteria in the *Task List* is not preserved when you switch between the Filter Tabs in the Web app.
